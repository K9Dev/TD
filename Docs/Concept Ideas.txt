Nice ideas TD

======================

[â€“]MountSwolmore 7 points 4 years ago* 

--I started with one idea, but they just kept coming... this isn't one coherent idea, but several potential interchangeable ones.--

The biggest problem I always seem to run across is there usually being a single best way to do things. 
There's almost always a tower that's the best or a one size fits all.
You start out with the cheap 'normal' tower, as the towers increase in price, they become objectively better. 
If you can put down the $500 rocket tower that kills everything in one shot, you don't really need the machine gun,
laser, slow, ice, poison, or whatever towers. The game just turns into a screen full of rockets. 
In games where you play until you lose, there just ends up being a map full of the same 1-2 towers and 
losing is simply a result of maxing the towers and running out of room.

I think a good design point would be to have all the towers start at the same level. 
$10 fire/ice/poison/earth or rocket/laser/machine gun or whatever scheme is chosen. 
They're all of relatively equal but not identical. You can then upgrade multiple facets of 
each tower to suit the level, monsters, and your play style. Attack speed, range, projectile speed, 
projectile count, damage, effects, effect magnitude, effect duration, etc.

There's an android TD game called Elements Defense or something close to that where as you kill monsters, 
they drop gems and then you use the gems in combinations of 3 to make 9 different possible towers. 
I thought that was a cool mechanic. Maybe there could be something like monsters that have rocket launchers 
on their back, and when you kill them, they have a chance to drop that and you can mount it on a tower. 
There's a could of different ways to do this.

Combine X weapons- rocket, rocket, rocket gets you a nuke that's slow, but with massive damage. 
Rocket, rocket, machine gun gets you a howitzer that's long range, fast explosive projectile, but slow reload. 
Machine gun, machine gun, rocket gets you a 50 cal assault cannon with explosive rounds. Rocket, machine gun, 
laser is a high attack rate, seeking, explosive weapon. Laser, laser, laser is a constant damage type weapon 
that does more damage the longer it fires; good for armor. Laser, laser, machine gun is a laser pulse rifle 
good for lots of fast, small targets. So on and so on...

Alternatively, have multiple categories that can be dropped/purchased/made/found. Weapon: rocket, machine gun, laser. 
Targeting system: long range, multi target, homing. Ammo depot: elemental/effect rounds (burning, freezing, stun, knockback, piercing, etc), 
Extra ammo (more shots without reloading), fast reload. Utility: more range, borrow range of neighbor towers, more resource per kill, 
enemies killed drop more components, more experience so tower levels faster. Rocket + Multiple rounds + burning = massive carpet bomb AOE+DOT. 
Machine gun + knockback + long range = sniper rifle. Laser + homing + pierce = a laser that bounces between X amount of enemies.

Yet another option- remove the "make a match" type system. You just build a tower with X mount points and add components to it in any order at any time. 
Just put on one rocket and it's a boring rocket launcher. Put on 10 rockets and it's a massive rocket battery. Put on 9 rockets and a targeting computer 
and it makes a rocket swarm that tracks targets. 8 rockets and two targeting computers makes a smaller swarm, but they track farther and faster
 and any 'overkill' rockets acquire new targets. Like modules will have combined effectiveness bonuses while different modules will have synergy bonuses. 
 You can upgrade the individual modules on the tower or just upgrade the tower itself to either make all modules more effective or raise the maximum number of modules allowed.

Only have one base tower type that's infinitely upgradeable. Upgrade attack speed 5 times and it's a machine gun. Upgrade it 100 times and it's a laser. 
Upgrade damage 5 times and it tickles enemies with pellets. Upgrade damage 100 times and it shoots massive slugs that bulldoze enemies. Upgrade range to 100 
and you have a sniper tower. Upgrade piercing to 5 and it goes through an enemy 20% of the time. Upgrade piercing to 100 and it plows through 5 enemies in a row. 
Every tower becomes whatever you upgrade it to be.

This one is a different idea... ONE tower that attacks. It shoots a single laser beam in a static direction. You can upgrade the tower to do more damage or 
shoot more lasers (one in every direction, 4 or 8 max depending how you count directions). You then build different mirrors to bounce the laser around the map with different results. 
A boring mirror will just bend the laser around a corner. A splitter will, duh, split the beam, but lower damage. A prism will result in a rainbow AOE shotgun. 
A convex lens will focus the beam doing more damage and extending range. A coupler will combine beams to increase damage. 
An optical capacitor will store the beam for intense bursts.
